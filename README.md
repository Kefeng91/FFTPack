# FFTPack
FFTPack aims to provide an easily usable package of functions using FFTPack library (Fortran 77).

## Two libraries
This repo contains two libraries:
1. FFTpack library
   contains FFT functions.
2. Forlab library
   Forlab is a Fortran module that provides a lot of functions for scientific computing 
   mostly inspired by Matlab and Python's package NumPy.

## Getting started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zoziha/FFTPack.git
cd FFTPack

```

## Requirements
To build this library you need
+ gfortran version > 10 (better or you need to modify the makefile)
+ gnu make
+ bash or something

## Make & test
```bash
make
make test

```
